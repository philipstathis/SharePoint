This is a sandboxed solution that I built using multiple blog sources and videos. It essentially adds an action in SharePoint designer to create a subsite given a site name.

It's in a very simple form right now but it might allow for creating custom code that can be called within SharePoint Designer. This would handle impersonation and expose the business logic to the client.
