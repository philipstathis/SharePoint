Hello,

This repository has some useful SharePoint applications that I put together and used.

The "Application Page" is essentially a way to add a .wsp without using the command line, through the Central Administration UI.

The "SPDCustomWorkflowActions" is a template for a sandboxed solution that adds an action to SharePoint designer to create a site.

There are blogs of this type of functionality available but none of them actually work properly without some necessary tweaking. 

This solution has the necessary files to perform a custom code operation in SharePoint designer with no need to deploy to the GAC.

Enjoy!
